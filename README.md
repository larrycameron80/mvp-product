#World Wi-Fi

World Wi-Fi â€” the company developing a blockchain platform 
that would integrate home routers and public hotspots around the world 
into a free global Wi-Fi network.

The network will be based on privately owned routers (most of which are residential). 
Their owners may oer free internet access and earn cryptocurrency through Internet advertising. 
In the end, everybody wins: the guest user no longer pays for access to the internet, 
the router owners generate revenue by sharing their resource, 
and advertisers reach their target audience.
